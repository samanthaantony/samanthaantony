I'm a Software Engineer and  I'm passionate in learning and growing in the Data Science, Machine Learning, Analytics and Cloud Computing Domain.

I learned a lot from the open-source community and love how collaboration and knowledge sharing began through open-source. 
I believe that greatness is determined by service to the community and through my skills I would like to contribute to solve business problems.
I love writing code while continuously updating my skills, reading books and knowing more about [Gospel of Jesus Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A7-11&version=ESV).

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Analytics and Machine Learning Projects.
